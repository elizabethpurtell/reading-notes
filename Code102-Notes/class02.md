## File Explorers

**There are two types of file explorers;** The standard 'find files by point and click,' or using a terminal. They each have similar tasks but using the *Terminal* can do so much more by using a command line.

**File Explorer Tasks:**

- Find files
- Change directories
- Move and copy files
- Open files
- Make new files/folders

**Terminal Tasks:**

## Answer

*What are four important features to look for in a text editor?*

1. Code completion
2. Syntax highlighting
3. Choice of visual themes to reduce eye strain
4. Ability to choose from several extensions

*What do the following commands do?*

- 'pwd': print working directory (you are here command)

- 'ls': list (shows the list of all the folders)

- 'cd': change directory (by using dots after the cd, you can move between directories)

- 'mkdi'r': make directory (make a new directory)

- 'touch': creates new, empty files. It is also used to change the timestamps.

*Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?* (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

  1. 'cd projects': this will show all the folders named projects.

  2. 'mkdir new-project': this will open/start a new project folder.

  3. 'touch new-project/newfile.md': this will make a new empty file under the new-project folder, named newfile.md (markdown file)

  4. 'cd ..' : this will take your back 2 directories from where you currently are.

  5. 'ls projects/new-project': this will pull a list of all the files related to the projects/new-project.
