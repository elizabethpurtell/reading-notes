# Class 10 -  Debugging and Error Handling

## Statement

This class provides insight into how we can debug, or test, our own code using free tools within our browsers. This is an essential part of building and testing our code.

### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

    Syntax errors are related to the structure and grammar of the programming language and are caught by the compiler or interpreter before the code is executed. In contrast, logic errors are errors in the program's logic, which can lead to incorrect behavior or output, and they may not always produce error messages. Debugging logic errors often involves analyzing the program's flow and logic to identify and correct the flawed logic, which can be more challenging than fixing syntax errors.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

    My errors usually have to do with using the wrong elements or forgetting a semi-colon, using the wrong type of brackets, etc. I use the 'format document' frequently so the code editor will help me catch them. Another big help is having someone who is experienced look over your code and spot the issues.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

    Debugging code is an everyday issue/need when you are coding. Frequently checking on how your code is holding up and working is extremely important. Also, you can use every type of debugger out there and you will still find the best help is usually having a team to work with. Sometimes it is really dificult to see the mistakes in your own work when you have been staring at it for hours. Having a team member look through it can help quite a lot.

### The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

    The JavaScript Debugger tool is an key feature provided by most web browsers for developers to help them identify and fix issues in their JavaScript code. Developers are able to pause the execution of their JS code, inspect variables and data, go through their code one line at a time, set breakpoints, and watch expressions. All of these things are critical for debugging and troubleshooting problems in web applications.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

    A breakpoint is like a stop sign for your code. You can place breakpoints at specific lines in your code. When the code reaches a breakpoint, it pauses, allowing you to look at the current state of your program.

3. What is the call stack?

    If an error occurs in your code, the debugger will give a detailed error message and show you the *call stack*, which is a list of functions that were called leading up to the error. This helps you trace the path of execution and pinpoint the source of the problem.
