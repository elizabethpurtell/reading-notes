### Continued Introduction to HTML

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

   - Semantics in HTML are crucial for enhancing accessibility, as they enable assistive technologies to accurately interpret and present web content to users with disabilities.
  
   - It plays a significant role in improving search engine optimization by helping search engines understand the structure and relevance of webpages.

   - Semantics contribute to maintainable and future-proof code, making it easier for developers to collaborate, update, and adapt web content to changing requirements and technologies.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

    - There are six levels of headings in HTML starting with h1 and going to h6. Each one represents a heading or subheading depending on the content in the document.

3. What are some uses for the < sup > and < sub > elements?

    - You will use the superscript and subscript elements when marking up things like math equations, dates and chemical formulas.

4. When using the < abbr > element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

    - You will need the < title > attribute added to provide the full expansion of the term.

### Learn CSS

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

    - You can apply CSS to HTML in three ways: external stylesheet, internal stylesheet and inline styles.

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

    - It is an inefficient way to use CSS and causes maintenance problems.
    - It mixes CSS presentational code with HTML & content creating code that is dificult to understand & read.

3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

    h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }
    - What is representing the selector? *The h2 is the selector*

    - Which components are the CSS declarations? *The declarations are the color and padding with each corresponding value of black and 5px.*

    - Which components are considered properties? *The properties are the color and padding.*

### Learn JS

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

    - A string is a data type that is enclosed in quote marks, single or double.

2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

    - Subtraction/Multiplication/Division
    - Assignment
    - Strict Equality

3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

### Making Decisions In Your Code â€“ Conditionals.

An if statement checks a *value* and if it evaluates to *true* , then the code block will execute.

1. What is the use of an else if?

    - To test if an expression returns true or not.

2. List 3 different types of comparison operators.

    - === and !==

    - < and >

    - <= and >=

3. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

    - The && operator requires all the expressions to evaluate to true in order for the whole expression to return true.
    - The || operator only requires one of the expressions to evaluate to true in order for the whole expression to return true.
