Emotional safety at work is a greatly needed ideal. This section of reading discusses how Google went about adding to the research. I have learned a little more about Google as a company from all this.

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

    The three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are safe interpersonal risk-taking, shared empathy and the role of the team was clearly understood and whether their work had impact.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

    Working as a paraeducator you are always with different teams of other educators, students, parents and more. Within our small group of paras we usually eat lunch together, discuss the workload and how to address students needs but we also discuss our home lives. It is safe to discuss these things because everyone is held under confidence in these roles so it feels easier to share.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

    Those people feel valued and a true part of their teams. They feel heard and known, they are unafraid to ask for help and to give it. Teams like these run at a much high efficiency because they aren't spending their mental load trying to block out "life" and have a separate personality for 60% of their life. More work gets done, more creativity is exposed.
