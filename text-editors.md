## Class 02: Command lines/Text editors


### Text Editors:	

**Word processors:** msword, google docs, apple pages, wordperfect, etc

**Code editors:** GitHubs Atom, MS- VS code, visual studio, NotePad++, Vim,Emacs, Nano, etc

### The Terminal- The command line interface (cli)

#### What exactly is a command line/terminal? 
It's a way to directly request information from your computer by simply entering simple text commands/requests. It then responds to your request with simple text information.

#### There are two types of file explorers- standard find files by point and click or using a terminal. They each have similar tasks but using the *Terminal* can do so much more by using a command line.

**File Explorer Tasks:**
- Find files
- Change directories
- Move and copy files
- Open files
- Make new files/folders

**Terminal Tasks:**
- Find files
- Change directories
- Move and copy files
- Make new files/folders
- Open files and more

### Beginning Commands

**Changing to a new directory:** cd (change directory), use “ cd projects” ,use with pwd, then ls to list

**To go back one directory:** cd .. (the amount of dots- however many directories back plus one)

**To create a new folder:** mkdir new-folder (make directory space new-folder)

**To create a new file in that folder:** cd new-folder, pwd, new-folder: touch myfile.md

**To go back to the home directory:** cd (all alone no dots)

**“Clear”** will just clear your screen

**Using the up/down arrows-** will cycle through your previous commands

**To search files by letter names:** cd p(plus the tab) - will show all the folders starting with p, add pr and get the projects.

**To get a branch diagram of all your folders:** tree command (only do this for a direct folder not the whole computer

**To stop a command from running:** cntrl button plus c

**To chain together a path you need use fwd/:** for example- cd projects/courses/102


## Answer

#### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. Code completion 
2. Syntax highlighting
3. Choice of visual themes to reduce eye strain
4. Ability to choose from several extensions

#### What do the following commands do?
- **pwd:** print working directory (you are here command)
- **ls:** list (shows the list of all the folders)
- **cd:** change directory (by using dots after the cd, you can move between directories)
- **mkdir:** make directory (make a new directory)
- **touch:** creates new, empty files. It is also used to change the timestamps.


#### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
1. **cd projects:** this will show all the folders named projects.
2. **mkdir new-project:** this will open/start a new project folder.
3. **touch new-project/newfile.md:** this will make a new empty file under the new-project folder, named newfile.md (markdown file)
4. **cd ..:** this will take your back 2 directories from where you currently are.
5. **ls projects/new-project:** this will pull a list of all the files related to the projects/new-project.
